*/Portfolio Landing Page
Create a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, which will later act as the landing page for your programming portfolio. Do not use a template to create your initial HTML and Bootstrap. Begin your work with an empty page and an initial empty commit.

Your CSS stylesheet must be named styles.css and reside in a css directory. Your HTML file page must be called index.html.

Your webpage should include the following content:

√   Your name.
√   An image of you, or something that represents you.
A list of projects you have created with active links to their GitHub pages sites or GitHub repositories.
For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses.
An “About Me” section.
Your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to take a class on programming, etc).
Your current interests/hobbies/skills.
Create a gh-pages branch so that your site can be viewed on GitHub Pages at your-username.github.io/portfolio (for example).
Don't forget your Git commits with an initial commit and a commit for every major code change, and include a README in your GitHub repository

Objectives
Your project will be reviewed on the following objectives:
The following HTML tags are all used: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, span

Project includes a custom-made stylesheet that uses cascading, the box model, and floats.

Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It will…"

The project repo contains a README that includes: author name, project name, description, setup instructions, link to GitHub Pages, and copyright info.

Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.

Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.

Required content was in place by the Friday deadline.

Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology.

Bootstrap classes are used to style the page. his means explicitly using classes mentioned on this page, not just linking the Bootstrap stylesheet.

Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
